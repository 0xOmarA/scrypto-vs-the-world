# Contribute

Adding code from other blockchains is a welcome contribution to this repository. However, before making a pull request, there are a few points which you must keep in mind:

* The code must be of how a fungible token is created on that blockchain.

* The code which you submit must have a source which backs it up. The source could be an official website or documentation, could be a github repository, or any form of proof of the code being submitted.

* For a fair comparison, the code which you submit must not include any comments of any sort. This is done to ensure a fair comparison between the code used on different blockchains.

* For a fair comparison, if the code has unit-tests along with the source code then they should be removed.
